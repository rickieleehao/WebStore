                <p>Our shoes today comes with a long and fascinating history. Borne out of necessity, they protect our
                    feet from the elements and hazards.</p>
                <p>It was not until the modern era where the shoe came to be the fashion and prestige statement today.

            <h3>Antiquity</h3>
            <div class="blog-section">
                <p>One of the oldest known shoes are sandals, made from sagebrush bark that dates back to 7000 BC. </p>

                    <p class="blog-caption">The shoe, as pictured above, is thought to date back around 3300 BCE.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The oldest known leather shoe, made from cowhide and laced with leather, was found in Armenia in
                    2008.</p>
                <p>Researchers suspect that shoes were prevalent before this period, but due to the perishable materials
                    used, it is hard to find evidence of earlier footwears.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Ancient Greek & Roman</h3>
            <div class="blog-section">
                <p>The Ancient Greeks didn't necessarily saw footwear as essential. The Greeks mostly saw shoes as
                    self-indulgent and unaesthetic.</p>
                <p>Many preferred to go barefoot. Furthermore, participants of the Ancient Olympic Games were barefoot
                    -- and naked, too.</p>
                <p>It wasn't until the Ancient Roman era that footwear became prevalent. The Roman regarded footwears as
                    a necessity of living in a civilised world. </p>

            <h3>Middle Ages</h3>

                    <p class="blog-caption">Pictured above is a replica of a turnshoe.</p>
                </div>
                <p>he Middle Ages sees shoes made using the turnshoe method. The turnshoe was named this way because it
                    was constructed inside-out and then turned right-side-out when completed.</p>
                <p>By the 1500s, the welted rand method had replaced the turnshoe method. The welted rand method sees
                    stiffer sole used. The sole offered better protection, and shoemakers sew the uppers part of the
                    shoes to the sole. However, shoes made this way were not tuned to each foot and are known as
                    "straights".</p>

                    <p class="blog-caption">Patten are the precursors to high heels.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Pattens, during this era, became popular amongst Europeans. Their designs were the precursor for
                    modern high-heels.</p>
                <p>Additionally, heels were common during this era. In 17th century France, Louis XIV of France even
                    banned everyone from wearing red heels, except for himself and his royal court.</p>

            <h3>Industrial Era & Modern Era</h3>
            <div class="blog-section">
                <p>The Industrial Revolution brought about one of the most significant changes in shoemaking. In the
                    early 19th century, traditional handicraft made up the majority of the shoemaking industry. However,
                    the process was almost fully mechanised by the end of the century. British soldiers are some of the
                    first to wear mechanically produced shoes during the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
                <p>1910 saw the development of AGO shoe, namely, stitchless glued-together shoes. Leather begins falling
                    out of fashion and is replaced by rubber and plastics.</p>
