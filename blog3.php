                <p>Shoes take on the abusive tasks of protecting us from the ground, whether heat, cold, moisture or
                    potential hazards. </p>
                <p>However, most of us don't pay attention to the very shoes that protected us.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Why you should take care of your shoes</h3>
            <div class="blog-section">
                <p>Shoes aren't the cheapest apparel to buy or own. A good pair of leather shoes or sneakers can cost
                    upwards of 800 MYR. </p>
                <p>Shoes may not need much maintenance, but a little care goes a long way to extend their lifespan.
                    Protecting your shoes means fewer cracks, damage, or smell. Eventually, this leads to a cleaner
                    cabinet, healthier feet and spending less.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Dos:</h3>
            <div class="blog-section">
                <ul class="blog-list">
                    <li>Keep your shoes away from moisture by using desiccants and stuff them with newspaper.</li>
                    <li>Use a shoe tree. A shoe tree is an insert to help maintain the shoes' shape.</li>
                    <li>For leather shoes, use polish and shiner.</li>
                    <li>For suede shoes, sponge and clean gently with a shampoo formulated for suede. Use a suede
                        conditioner.</li>
                    <li>Keep the soles clean, tap the shoes to get rid of the dust, and use a brush to deep clean.</li>
                    <li>For ageing shoes, use hydrogen peroxide and baking soda to rejuvenate them. Apply and brush
                        lightly with a toothbrush.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Don'ts:</h3>
            <div class="blog-section">
                <ul class="blog-list">
                    <li>Expose your shoe under direct sunlight.</li>
                    <li>Wear the same shoes all the time. Shoes need downtime to breathe.</li>
                    <li>Put your shoes into a dark closet right after you take them off. Shoes need airing out before
                        being stored.</li>
                    <li>Leave your shoes unused for extended periods. Shoes should be worn!</li>
                </ul>
